Design meerting Notes

### Meeting Notes

#### Key Objectives:
1. **Maximizing Client Engagement**:
   - Create an environment to keep clients immersed longer.
   - Offer dual environments: Nature and Coliseum, with transitions between them (e.g., walking into a tree to enter the Coliseum).

2. **Emotional Impact**:
   - Incorporate high-emotion elements (e.g., vertigo-inducing moments) to create lasting memories.
   - Fear as a key emotion for engagement and memorability.
   - Use sound and visuals for consistent branding to trigger recall.

3. **Interactive Experience**:
   - Simplify mechanics for ease of use, especially for first-time users.
   - Design activities with immediate impact (e.g., pressing one button to create significant changes like altering day/night cycles).
   - Include a catalog or menu for item selection, with a point-and-shoot mechanism for ease.

4. **Thematic Design**:
   - Combine mythological storytelling with practical sales narratives.
   - Design interactions that are simple yet impactful, tied to the narrative and sales goals.

5. **Sales Funnel Integration**:
   - Align the experience with the sales funnel:
     1. Awareness: Engage clients with the novelty of VR.
     2. Interest: Show applications for their business.
     3. Decision: Highlight ROI through potential leads and sales.
     4. Action: Encourage logical decisions backed by emotions.

#### Design Elements:
- **Gameplay Mechanics**:
  - Include activities like slicing, shooting, grabbing, and throwing to win points.
  - Build mechanics using pre-made plugins for faster development.
  - Ensure natural movements and intuitive interactions.
  
- **Branding & Memorabilia**:
  - Incorporate branded elements like logos that generate in-game rewards (e.g., money appearing upon touching the logo).
  - Provide tangible takeaways (e.g., a branded box) as a physical reminder of the VR experience.

#### Technical Considerations:
- Use hand tracking or simple button mechanics to ensure usability.
- Incorporate realistic physics to simulate weight, mass, and movement (e.g., a chain reacting naturally to touch).
- Leverage AR/VR tools like the Quest 3 for the project.

#### Action Items:
1. **Immediate Next Steps**:
   - Digest the discussed ideas and refine them into actionable plans.
   - Transcribe key takeaways into five bullet points to present to Matilda for alignment.

2. **Team Coordination**:
   - Schedule overlapping team time for Friday to review designs and continue development.
   - Assign tasks for VR-related work to teams not directly involved in the design meeting.

3. **Development Priorities**:
   - Finalize 5 core gameplay mechanics tied to the storyline and sales narrative.
   - Work on immediate certification of actions to build curiosity and engagement.

#### Logistics:
- **Next Meeting**:
  - With Matilda on Friday.
  - Ensure team overlap during the meeting for collaboration.

- **Recording Duration**: Approximately 40 minutes. 

These notes summarize the key discussions, objectives, and next steps to ensure alignment moving forward.
